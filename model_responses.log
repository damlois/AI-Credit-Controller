Okay, I need to write a professional email from Interprais to Taofiq Sulayman about an overdue invoice. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The invoice is ₦5000, due on 2025-06-18. The email should be polite, respectful, persuasive, but not make up any extra details. It should be brief, warm, and straight to the point. Also, encourage the client to acknowledge the reminder and commit to a payment date.

First, the subject line needs to be clear. Maybe "Reminder: Invoice Due on [Date]" but include the date. Wait, the due date is 2025-06-18, so maybe "Reminder: Invoice ₦5000 Due on June 18, 2025". That's specific.

Now the greeting. Start with "Dear Taofiq Sulayman,". Then a friendly opener, like "I hope this message finds you well." Then mention the invoice. Need to state the amount and due date clearly. "We wanted to kindly remind you that the invoice for ₦5000, which was due on June

Okay, I need to help the user by writing a professional email from Interprais to Lois Gold about an overdue invoice. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the email should be polite, respectful, and persuasive. It's a reminder for an invoice of ₦3000 due on 2025-06-18. I shouldn't add any extra details not provided. The key points are: mention the invoice, the due date, ask for acknowledgment, and a clear commitment on payment. Keep it brief, warm, and to the point.

I should start with a subject line that's clear, maybe "Reminder: Invoice ₦3000 Due on 2025-06-18". Then a greeting. The body needs to mention the invoice number and due date, but since the user didn't provide the invoice number, I'll leave a placeholder. I should state that the payment is overdue and ask for confirmation. Also, request a specific time frame for payment. End with appreciation and contact info. Make sure it's concise and friendly.

Wait, the user said not to assume any extra details. So I can't mention the invoice number
